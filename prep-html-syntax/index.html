    <p style="color: darkred">Darth Maul was a formidable warrior and scheming mastermind. He wielded an intimidating double-bladed lightsaber and
    fought with a menacing ferocity. A deadly, agile Sith Lord trained by the evil Darth Sidious. Unrivaled in the dark side lightsaber form of Juyo.</p>
